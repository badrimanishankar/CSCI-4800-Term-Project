Currently, UGA is using Banner, a student registration self service system known as Athena. We find that registration for classes is difficult to navigate for students who need to register for classes, and potentially, instructors. The lack of fluidity on the class registration page leads to a decrease in proficiency when registering for classes. For example, it’s difficult to coordinate the course schedule in the current interface. The information of class time and location is specified under different tabs. Users have to shuffle through multiple clicks to get the information of a course and then go back to the original page and repeat the process for another class. It requires to memorize information including class name, location, and time in order to register for classes. This memory load of information from different classes makes users frustrated when registering for classes. The lack of fluidity due to the page layout can lead to both current and new users to be overwhelmed by the amount of information that is contained on the page. In addition to that, the inefficient use of space can also be seen as a hindrance in completing registration in a timely manner. A factor that may contribute to our problem is self efficacy, new students who are not used to self-registering through Banner, may be lost when thrown into this site. Another factor could include the lack of instructions provided to the user, there are guides as to how to use this registration page, but there is no clear indication of where the instructions are located to students on Athena. 

Potential Users:
Undergraduate, Graduate and PhD students, and Instructors are impacted by the lack of usability of Athena. Since Banner, the brand name for Athena, has subscribers from other universities, the potential users and stakeholders also include students and instructors from other universities that use Banner as well.  The majority that is severely impacted consists of new students who are unable to figure out the design layout of Athena as it was intended by the UI designer. It’s too 

Users would benefit through faster registration for courses, improved visibility of relevant information, less clutter, more fluidity, and a more user-friendly experience for new students.
